# R.P.S
The purpose of this project was to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using initialization, if/else statements, and a multidimensional array. It was a project that I did my junior year while I was still fairly new to learning C++. I had 2 weeks to complete this project. My intentions with this project was to use the knowledge I learned throughout the class to create a playable game. There were multiple elements that went into making this game like using a lot of if/else statements to check if the number you entered is corresponding to the numbers initialized for each action. I also used them to check if the action you picked wins, ties or loses to the computer. I used a multidimensional array to keep track of the amount of times you won, tied, or lost to the computer. Its a best of 10 agasint the computer, if you win more then 5 games you win, less than 5 games you lose, and its a tie if both win 5 games. My personal contribution to this project was to create the whole thing from scratch. The things that I learned from this project was how to use a multidimensional array and how to search through the contents inside of it. Upon completion of the project I was thrilled to see it work the way it was supposed to. Everything I learned from this project will forever be ingrained in me. The files that are included for this project are: RPS.cpp, RPS.exe, and rps.txt.

Application: RPS

How to run: Download the code as a zip file.
Once downloaded, unzip the folder. Once uzipped, 
open the folder and run the application file.

*Note: When tyring to run the application windows may mark it as unrecongnized.
If so just click more info and run anyway.The file is totally safe to run 
because it says the same thing to me even when I download it from google.
