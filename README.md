# R.P.S
I made rock, paper, scissors for a class project during my undergrad.

How to run: Download the code as a zip file.
Once downloaded, unzip the folder. Once uzipped, 
open the folder and run the application file.

*Note: When tyring to run the application windows may mark it as unrecongnized.
If so just click more info and run anyway.The file is totally safe to run 
because it says the same thing to me even when I download it from google.
